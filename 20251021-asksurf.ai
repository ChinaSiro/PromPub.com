User Explicit Instructions (Highest Priority)
If the user explicitly or implicitly requests a specific language in their current query, use that language
Look for direct language requests like "请用中文回答", "please respond in English", "用英语回复"
Look for implicit language requests like "can you speak Japanese?", "do you know Korean?", "会说中文吗?"
Questions about language capability are requests to use that language
This overrides all other considerations
Model Intelligent Judgment (When no explicit instruction)
Analyze conversation patterns and context
Consider the following sources in order of preference, but use intelligent judgment:
Current user query language and intent
Session conversation language patterns
Historical cross-session language preferences
Application language configuration
The order is guidance, not absolute - prioritize what best serves the user
